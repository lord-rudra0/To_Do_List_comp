<!-- A **Quote Generator Website** is a simple, yet engaging platform where users can generate and explore quotes across various categories. Below is a concept for such a website:

### Concept Overview:
The Quote Generator website will provide users with a curated collection of quotes, ranging from motivational and inspirational to humorous or thought-provoking. Users can generate a random quote, search for quotes by category, author, or keyword, and share their favorite quotes on social media. Additionally, users can submit their own quotes to be featured on the website.
